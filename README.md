#### Description:

This code is a simple text-based ordering system for a restaurant called In-N-Out. It allows the user to select items from a menu, calculates the total cost of the order (including tax), and displays the order details. Here's how the code works.

The code starts by importing the necessary modules: os for clearing the console, time for a brief delay, and Decimal from the decimal module for precise decimal arithmetic. The program displays a welcome message and the menu options using a series of print statements. The My_library dictionary stores the prices of each menu item, while the My_display dictionary stores the names of the menu items corresponding to their respective numbers. The program enters a while loop that allows the user to add items to their order. The loop continues until the user chooses not to add anything else. Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter a number corresponding to the desired menu item. The program updates the no_tax variable by adding the price of the selected item from the My_library dictionary using the user's input as the key. The console is cleared, and the selected menu item is added to the display list. The current total (no_tax) and the current order (display) are displayed to the user. The user is asked if they want to add anything else. The input is stored in the repeat variable. If the user's input is affirmative, the loop continues by setting x to True. Otherwise, the loop is terminated with a break statement. After exiting the loop, the no_tax variable is multiplied by 1.08 to add 8% tax. The result is stored in the taxed variable. The taxed value is rounded to two decimal places using the round function. The final total (taxed) is displayed to the user along with a closing message. The console is cleared, and the program waits for 10 seconds before terminating.

The code provides a basic ordering system for the In-N-Out restaurant, allowing customers to select items and calculate the total cost of their order, including tax. It demonstrates the use of dictionaries to store menu items, prices, and their corresponding numbers for easy retrieval. The code assumes a fixed tax rate of 8%. If the tax rate changes, the code would need to be modified. It uses the Decimal class for precise decimal arithmetic to avoid any floating-point rounding errors that can occur when dealing with money. Overall, this code provides a simple and straightforward way to order items from the menu, calculate the total cost with tax, and display the order details to the user.
